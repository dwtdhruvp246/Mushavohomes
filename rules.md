# Mushavo Homes Product And Engineering Rules

Last updated: August 9, 2026

Status: Draft for owner review. This file records the current product decisions, business rules, security rules, UI expectations, and regression checks for Mushavo Homes. If this file conflicts with old code or an old continuation prompt, this file represents the newer decision unless the owner explicitly changes it.

## 1. Purpose And Change Control

1. Read this file before changing Mushavo Homes code, SQL, pricing, roles, permissions, subscriptions, invitations, deletion, or navigation.
2. Do not restart the project or replace working features with a new implementation unless explicitly requested.
3. A new feature must preserve all unrelated existing functions.
4. When a product decision changes, update this file in the same change.
5. Search for every implementation path affected by a rule. Do not patch only the screen where the bug was reported.
6. Rules must be enforced in both places where applicable:
   - frontend visibility and validation
   - Supabase RLS, RPCs, constraints, or triggers
7. Never claim a rule is fixed until all account types and creation paths affected by it have been checked.
8. Use current terminology and current rules. Do not revive an older rule because old code still contains it.

## 2. Current Files And Source Of Truth

The public website and client area are separate files:

- `index.html`: public home page
- `about.html`: public About page
- `pricing.html`: public Pricing page
- `contact.html`: public Contact and enquiry page
- `client.html`: login and authenticated client area
- `i18n.js`: shared English, Bahasa Melayu, and Chinese translations
- `mushavo-logo.png`: shared logo
- `rentradar_loop1_schema.sql`: Supabase schema, functions, triggers, storage, and RLS
- `rules.md`: current product and engineering rules

Working source folder:

```text
C:\Users\HP\Desktop\Mushavo Homes
```

User testing/output folder:

```text
C:\Users\HP\Documents\Codex\2026-06-29\ne\outputs
```

Rules:

- Work from the canonical Windows folder using a focused Git branch created from the latest GitHub `main`.
- After validation, commit and push the focused branch; merge into `main` only after the owner approves testing.
- When a fix requires SQL or HTML code, update the whole relevant local file instead of only sending loose snippets. SQL changes belong in `rentradar_loop1_schema.sql`; HTML/client changes belong in the affected `.html` file. Snippets may be shown only as an explanation after the file has been updated, or when file editing is genuinely blocked and that blocker is clearly stated.
- Do not overwrite `client.html` while editing the public site.
- Do not move the client app back into `index.html` unless explicitly requested.
- Keep SQL local; the owner runs it in Supabase.

## 3. Brand And Terminology

- Product name: Mushavo Homes
- Tagline: Your property, handled simply.
- Do not display RentRadar, Rent Radar, or Musha.
- IPM means Individual Portfolio Manager.
- PMC means Property Management Company.
- Use `IPM`, not `Freelancer`, `Freelancer Staff`, generic `Staff`, or `IPC`, in user-facing IPM labels.
- Use `PMC`, not `Management Company`, in normal user-facing labels.
- Internal database identifiers may retain legacy names such as `freelancer`, `management_leader`, `management_staff`, and `management_companies` until a deliberate migration is approved.
- Landlord staff means personal staff created by one landlord and serving only that landlord.
- PMC staff means internal staff created by one PMC and serving only that PMC.
- Admin staff means Mushavo Homes' own staff, created by the super admin and assigned to one or more countries.
- Tenant means a global Mushavo Homes identity linked to landlord-specific tenant relationships.

## 4. Architecture And Security

- Current app architecture is static HTML, Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, and Supabase.
- The Supabase project URL and anon key are public browser configuration and may be visible in Inspect.
- Never place a Supabase service-role key, database password, or other privileged secret in any HTML or frontend JavaScript.
- Supabase RLS, secure RPCs, constraints, triggers, private storage buckets, and signed URLs are the security boundary.
- UI hiding is user experience, not security.
- Passwords must never be stored in app tables, invite metadata, logs, or browser storage.
- Invite validation must use an RPC. Do not make `invite_tokens` publicly readable.
- Invite tokens are single-use and expire after 48 hours.
- Storage buckets for lease documents, payment proofs, and maintenance photos remain private.
- Downloads use short-lived signed URLs.
- Use structured database functions for multi-step operations that must be atomic.

## 5. Account Types And Ownership

### 5.1 Super Admin

- Has platform-wide access across all countries.
- Can add countries.
- Can create, edit, suspend, archive, unarchive, and permanently delete platform-managed users where the product allows it.
- Can manage landlords, admin staff, IPMs, PMCs, tenants, enquiries, and platform finance.
- Can view archived users.

### 5.2 Admin Staff

- Created by the super admin through an invite.
- Can be assigned one or more countries.
- Must see and use the same operational actions as the super admin, but only for records in assigned countries.
- Cannot add countries.
- Cannot view or manage records outside assigned countries.
- Enquiries are filtered by the enquiry country.
- A suspended admin staff account cannot log in.
- Admin staff edits must preserve all selected countries and preselect them when the edit dialog is reopened.

### 5.3 Landlord

- Owns properties, units, landlord-specific tenant relationships, leases, rent records, and maintenance records.
- Can use the direct landlord-only free signup path.
- Can also be invited by admin, admin staff, an IPM, or a PMC.
- Has My Account and Settings as separate pages.
- Can create personal landlord staff subject to plan limits.
- Can connect to an IPM or PMC subject to plan and assignment rules.

### 5.4 Landlord Staff

- Created only by a landlord invite.
- Serves that landlord only.
- Must not have a landlord switcher, Add Landlord field, landlord code field, or multi-landlord request flow.
- Receives permissions from the landlord before access is accepted.
- Its access is also affected by the landlord's subscription state.
- When deleted by its landlord, the account is permanently removed from Supabase Auth/profile so the same email can be invited again.
- Historical records must retain useful staff snapshots or nullable references where required; deleting the login must not corrupt payment, lease, or maintenance history.

### 5.5 IPM

- Created/invited by the Mushavo Homes admin. There is no public IPM signup.
- Can serve multiple landlords according to its subscription limit.
- Uses a Landlords page to search for an existing landlord by email.
- If found, requests access.
- If not found, can invite the landlord to create a free Mushavo Homes landlord account.
- Landlord approval and explicit permissions are required before landlord data becomes accessible.
- Has My Account with subscription details.
- IPM is not a personal landlord staff member.
- IPM does not have a free subscription plan unless the owner later explicitly adds one.

### 5.6 PMC Leader

- Created/invited by the Mushavo Homes admin. There is no public PMC signup.
- Has a landlord-style operational dashboard and pages.
- Can add internal PMC staff before connecting any landlord.
- Uses a separate Connected Landlords page, not a landlord section mixed into the Staff page.
- Searches existing landlords by email or invites a missing landlord onto the free landlord plan.
- Requires landlord approval and explicit permissions before accessing landlord data.
- Can permanently delete its internal PMC staff accounts.
- Has My Account with plan, status, expiry, and limits.
- The PMC company name appears in the header for both the leader and PMC staff.

### 5.7 PMC Staff

- Created by the PMC leader.
- Serves only that PMC.
- Does not require landlord approval merely to activate the Mushavo Homes account.
- Can register and log in immediately after accepting the PMC invite and setting a password, even when no landlord is connected or assigned.
- Access to landlord operations is limited by both:
  - the permissions the landlord granted to the PMC
  - the narrower permissions the PMC leader granted to the PMC staff member
- Must never receive a permission broader than the PMC itself has.

### 5.8 Tenant

- A tenant login is a global Mushavo Homes identity and is not owned permanently by one landlord.
- A tenant can move and later connect to another landlord using the same login.
- Landlord-specific `tenants` rows are relationship records, not separate global identities.
- The same tenant profile can have multiple historical landlord relationships but cannot have duplicate active relationships with the same landlord.

## 6. Account Creation And Invitation Rules

### 6.1 Landlord Defaults

Every new landlord created through any path must receive the same defaults:

- plan: `free`
- status: `active`
- display label: `Active - Free`
- practical expiry: none; current compatibility value is `2099-12-31T23:59:59.000Z`
- property limit: 1
- unit limit: 1
- personal landlord staff limit: 0
- IPM/PMC connection limit: 1
- Finance page included for the one free unit

This applies to:

- direct landlord signup
- super admin invite
- admin staff invite
- IPM landlord invite
- PMC landlord invite

No landlord creation path may default to Starter - Trial or any other paid/trial plan.

### 6.2 Direct Signup Duplicate Prevention

- Direct signup is for landlords only.
- Before creating a Supabase Auth user, check both normalized email and normalized full phone number.
- If either already exists, stop before `auth.signUp()`.
- Show: `Your account already exists. Please contact Mushavo Homes Support.`
- A duplicate check must not leave a partial Auth user behind.
- Phone matching uses country code plus national number in a normalized international format.

### 6.3 Invite Acceptance

- Email from an invite is read-only.
- Full name must be editable when the invite creator did not provide a valid final name, including landlord invitations from an IPM or PMC.
- After acceptance, update the existing pending invite/relationship state. Do not create a second visible row for the same person.
- Accepted profiles and unused invite rows must be reconciled by invite ID, profile ID, and normalized email.
- Once accepted, a stale Invited row must not remain beside the Approved row.
- Staff request approval must open the permission checklist first. The relationship is accepted only when the landlord clicks Accept at the bottom of that checklist.

### 6.4 Phone Inputs

- Every place that collects a phone number must include a country-code selector.
- Store a normalized full international number.
- Apply this to public signup, admin invites/edits, landlord/tenant/staff/IPM/PMC forms, contact details, and account settings.

## 7. Subscription Plans, Statuses, And Access

### 7.1 Combined Plan And Status

Plan and status are displayed as one combined value.

Landlord examples:

- Active - Free
- Starter - Trial
- Starter - Active
- Growth - Trial
- Growth - Active
- Portfolio - Trial
- Portfolio - Active
- Custom - Trial
- Custom - Active

IPM and PMC use the same combined plan/status idea using their own plan names.

Admin and admin staff subscription dialogs use one Plan / Status dropdown, not separate Plan and Status dropdowns.

### 7.2 Status Meaning

- `active`: account is allowed while plan conditions are valid.
- `trial`: account is allowed until trial expiry.
- `suspended`: explicitly paused by Mushavo Homes admin, regardless of an unexpired date.
- `expired`: derived when a paid/trial expiry date is in the past.
- Free - Active has no practical expiry and must not become expired because of a compatibility date or malformed old date.

Do not treat Trial as Suspended.

### 7.3 Access Screens

Suspended account message and expired account message are different.

For an expired subscription:

```text
Your Mushavo Homes subscription has expired, and your account access is currently paused. Your data is still safely stored.

Please contact support to renew your subscription and restore access.
```

For a suspended account, state that access was paused by the Mushavo Homes administrator and direct the user to support. Do not call it expired.

Landlord staff inherit the landlord subscription lockout. PMC staff inherit the PMC subscription lockout.

### 7.4 Expiry Calculation

- Supabase may return a date or a full timestamp.
- Parse only the date component safely; never append a second `T00:00:00` to a full timestamp.
- Compare dates consistently in the configured business timezone/date convention.
- Admin list status, account top badge, My Account, filters, and lockout logic must all use the same computed status helper.
- When expiry passes, the list must show Expired even if the stored status remains Active.
- When the admin saves Free - Active, every shell must refresh and display Active - Free immediately.
- When the admin saves any landlord Plan / Status, reopening Manage Subscription must show the saved value, not the first dropdown option.
- If old data contains duplicate `landlord_subscriptions` rows for one landlord, save and reload logic must prefer the newest subscription and keep duplicates from pulling the UI back to Free - Active.
- If stored landlord `subscription_plan` is stale or inconsistent but the saved limits clearly match Starter, Growth, or Portfolio, admin dialogs must infer and display the matching plan instead of blindly showing Free - Active.

### 7.5 Limits

- A limit of zero is a real limit. Never use `value || default` for numeric limits; use nullish handling such as `value ?? default`.
- Allow creation when `current_count < limit`.
- Block creation when `current_count >= limit`.
- A limit of 2 with 1 existing record must allow the second record.
- Count accepted records and active pending invites deliberately. Do not accidentally count the same accepted person and stale invite twice.
- Convert all database limit failures to clear Mushavo Homes messages.
- Never show RLS, constraint, trigger, SQLSTATE, or raw Supabase errors to users.

### 7.6 Pricing Rules

- Zimbabwe prices display in USD.
- Malaysia prices display in MYR.
- Country pricing is market-specific, not a currency conversion only.
- Pricing page supports monthly/yearly toggle.
- Yearly billing gives one month free, not two.
- Landlord Free plan has a Sign up for free CTA.
- IPM and PMC plans have no public free signup.
- The approved pricing workbook is the source for exact price amounts and limits; do not invent or silently change prices in HTML.
- Unit limit wording must clearly state whether it is total units or units per property. Current product intent is units per property where shown as such.
- For IPM, a property limit refers to the maximum number of properties a connected landlord may have only where the plan explicitly defines it that way. Avoid ambiguous labels.
- PMC plans must explicitly include unit allowances; do not omit units from the pricing matrix.

## 8. Archive, Delete, Drop, And Historical Records

These actions are different and must not share vague confirmation text.

### 8.1 Archive

- Hides an active business relationship while preserving history.
- Only admin can see archived platform users and unarchive them.
- Archiving a tenant relationship terminates active occupancy as appropriate and marks the unit vacant, but does not delete the global tenant Auth/profile.
- Archiving a landlord, property, tenant relationship, lease, or staff relationship must not silently erase historical financial, lease, receipt, or maintenance records.

### 8.2 Permanent Delete

- Must use an in-app confirmation dialog with precise consequences.
- Super admin can permanently delete landlords, tenants, IPMs, PMCs, admin staff, and other supported accounts.
- A landlord permanently deletes its personal landlord staff login.
- A PMC leader permanently deletes its PMC staff login.
- Permanent deletion of an Auth account must not break retained historical rows; use nullable foreign keys, snapshots, or archival records where history is legally/business-required.
- Platform payment history should remain where designed, even if its payer becomes `Unassigned` after a permanent deletion.

### 8.3 Unassign Or Drop

- Unassigning an IPM/PMC removes access, not the landlord's data.
- A Drop Landlord action removes the landlord relationship and all visibility of that landlord's data from the IPM/PMC account.
- The underlying landlord account, properties, units, tenants, leases, payments, and maintenance records remain owned by and visible to the landlord.
- After dropping, the IPM/PMC must not retain or continue to view cached landlord operational data.
- Confirmation copy must say exactly this; do not vaguely say `their data will stay` without identifying whose access is removed and whose records are retained.

## 9. Navigation, Session, And Page Visibility

- All expected navigation pages remain visible for staff account types even when permissions are not granted.
- Opening a page without permission shows an appropriate empty/restricted state; it must not remove the page from navigation solely because no permission is selected.
- Buttons, fields, sensitive details, and actions inside the page remain permission-gated.
- Fresh PMC leader login lands on Dashboard, not Staff.
- Changing browser tab, minimizing the browser, or returning from another app must not reset the user to Dashboard or reload all page state.
- Supabase `SIGNED_IN` or token refresh events for the same current user must not call the full fresh-login flow.
- Restore the last valid page for the current shell.
- Refresh buttons reload current page data and do not route to Dashboard.
- The app must never remain permanently on `Loading Mushavo Homes...`.
- Account type appears beside the logo where appropriate.
- PMC leader and PMC staff show the PMC company name in the agreed header position.

## 10. Permission Model

### 10.1 General Rules

- Permissions form a parent-child tree.
- A child permission has no effect without its required parent.
- If a permission is not granted, its button, editable field, dropdown, sensitive information, and direct action must not appear.
- Backend enforcement must still reject a direct unauthorized request.
- Do not use broad legacy `manage` permissions for unrelated actions.
- Use exact permission helpers with names matching the action.
- Test each permission separately with every other sibling permission off.
- Test important combinations and parent-child dependencies.

### 10.2 Properties And Units

- View properties:
  - shows property name, address, city, and landlord name
  - does not by itself reveal units
- Add property requires View properties.
- Edit property requires View properties.
- Archive property requires View properties.
- View units requires View properties and controls:
  - Open Units button
  - unit information
  - unit details
  - maintenance history under the property/unit
- Add unit requires View units.
- Edit unit requires View units.
- Archive unit requires View units.
- Mark unit vacant requires View units.
- Tenant details inside a unit require both View units and View tenants.
- Lease details inside a unit require the relevant unit and lease permissions.

### 10.3 Tenants

- View tenants controls tenant lists and tenant details.
- Add tenant requires View tenants.
- Edit tenant requires View tenants.
- Archive tenant requires View tenants.
- Tenant details appearing on Properties/Units also require View tenants.

### 10.4 Leases And Documents

- View leases requires relevant unit visibility.
- Create lease requires unit visibility and tenant visibility.
- Edit lease requires View leases.
- Terminate lease requires View leases.
- View lease PDFs requires View leases and View lease documents.
- Upload/replace lease PDFs requires View leases and Upload lease documents.
- Do not use broad `can_manage_leases` for UI actions. Keep exact helpers.

### 10.5 Payments And Finance

- View payments controls payment lists and payment details.
- Log payments controls manual payment forms.
- Verify payments controls approval of tenant submissions.
- Reject payments controls rejection action.
- View proof files controls proof open/download actions.
- View finance controls finance reporting.
- A View button on recent payments opens the complete payment details.
- Notes entered with a payment are visible in payment history for all authorized account types.

### 10.6 Maintenance

Use clear exact permissions:

- View maintenance: see maintenance requests.
- Create maintenance: show and use Log Maintenance/New Request.
- Assign maintenance: show and use assigned-staff dropdown.
- Update maintenance: change status, priority, and editable request details.
- Add resolution notes: add work-completed/resolution notes.
- Delete maintenance: landlord-only unless explicitly expanded later.

Rules:

- If Create maintenance is off, hide Log Maintenance.
- If Assign maintenance is off, hide every assignment dropdown, including in detail dialogs.
- Description display must not be confused with assignment or update permissions.
- Assignment lists only include eligible people under the active landlord/PMC and within the permitted property/unit scope.
- Never list random platform staff, another landlord's staff, or another PMC's staff.
- Maintenance View opens complete work details and history.

### 10.7 Staff And Partner Permissions

- When approving a landlord staff, IPM, or PMC request, open the permission checklist before accepting.
- Editing an accepted relationship reopens the checklist with current values selected.
- The landlord can unassign an IPM/PMC relationship.
- A landlord may assign only one external operator to the same property/unit scope: one IPM or one PMC, not both. Personal landlord staff are outside this exclusivity rule.
- PMC staff permissions cannot exceed the landlord-to-PMC permission envelope.

## 11. Properties And Units UX

- Properties page contains properties and their units; there is no separate Units navigation page for landlords.
- Open Units opens the units panel directly beneath the selected property card, not at the bottom of the full property list.
- Only one property panel needs to be open at a time unless a later design explicitly supports multiple.
- Property Edit uses the top property form:
  - click Edit on a property
  - populate Property name, Address, and City at the top
  - change Add Property to Edit Property/Save Changes
  - provide Cancel
  - save updates the selected property
- Do not squeeze property editing into a small card.
- Unit edit must be usable on small screens and follow the same clear editing pattern where practical.
- Unit details for landlord and PMC contexts show which eligible staff/operator is assigned to the unit.
- Tenant Unit Details show assigned contact name, phone, email, and contact type when available.

## 12. Tenant Lifecycle And Search

- Tenant creation starts with search by email.
- Do not show the Add Tenant registration form by default.
- If an existing tenant is found, request/link that global tenant to the landlord relationship.
- If no tenant is found, then reveal the Add Tenant fields and allow a new invitation.
- Landlord, IPM, and PMC tenant flows follow this pattern within their permitted landlord scope.
- Existing tenant accounts sign in with their existing password to accept a new landlord relationship.
- New tenant accounts set a password from the invite.
- Deleting/archiving one landlord relationship does not delete the global tenant login.
- A landlord cannot see tenant information belonging only to another landlord relationship.
- Tenant page lists property name where applicable.
- PMC tenant lists do not show an unnecessary tenant ID column.

## 13. Leases

- Landlords can upload or replace lease agreement PDFs.
- PDF only, maximum 20 MB.
- Tenant can download the active lease agreement.
- Lease details include property, unit, tenant, dates, rent, deposit status, notes, and agreement where authorized.
- Unit Current Tenant + Lease includes View Lease.
- Deleting/terminating a lease updates vacancy correctly.
- Upcoming Lease Expirations include property name and a View action that opens lease and tenant details.
- Lease and payment history must remain available after normal archival transitions.

## 14. Payments, Rent Balance, And Receipts

### 14.1 Payment Purpose

- Payment is for includes rent periods, advance rent where allowed, unpaid refundable Deposit when the active lease has `deposit_paid = false`, and Other.
- If Other is selected, show a required description field.
- Rent payment amount label may say Rent amount.
- Deposit and Other payment amount labels must say Amount.
- This applies to tenant submissions, manual logging, and unit quick payment forms.

### 14.2 Rent Balance

- Tenant Current Balance is rent-only.
- Only verified rent payments reduce rent balance.
- Maintenance, repairs, deposits, fees, and Other payments do not reduce rent balance.
- Copy should say: `Based on this month's rent and verified rent payments only.`
- Payment purpose must be stored structurally; do not infer it only from free-text notes.

### 14.3 Deposits And Revenue

- Refundable security deposits are not rental revenue when received.
- Keep deposits separate from rent revenue in finance reporting.
- Verified deposit payments may mark the lease deposit as paid, but they must not be included in landlord revenue totals, charts, or average rent payment calculations.
- Only recognize a deposit as revenue if a legitimate later event applies it to rent/damages according to the business/legal process.

### 14.4 Proofs And Receipts

- Accept proof uploads as JPEG, PNG, WebP, or PDF, maximum 10 MB.
- Use private storage and signed URLs.
- Receipt numbers are generated by the database without ambiguous column references.
- Payment notes are visible in authorized payment histories.
- Payment View opens complete details, including purpose, description, notes, proof, payer, property/unit, date, and verification information.

## 15. Finance

### 15.1 Admin Finance

- Shows platform revenue and recorded subscription payments.
- Separates money by country.
- Includes landlords, IPMs, and PMCs as payer types.
- IPM must display as IPM, not Staff.
- Supports Record Payment, Edit, Delete, dates covered, amount, notes, and filters.
- Deleting/archiving a payer should not silently erase valid platform payment history; nullable payer references may display as Unassigned.

### 15.2 Landlord Finance

- Reports landlord rental revenue and related finance data.
- Supports filters, property selection, date range, charts where useful, and download/export.
- Free landlord plan includes finance for its allowed unit.
- Deposits remain separate from revenue.

### 15.3 IPM And PMC Finance

- Uses landlords instead of countries as the primary grouping.
- Shows the details of connected landlords.
- Includes Record Payment for payments made by landlords to the IPM/PMC.
- Supports edit/delete and partnership/contract date context.
- Dropped landlords no longer expose operational data, but legitimate IPM/PMC contract payment records may remain as the IPM/PMC's own financial history with an appropriate snapshot, subject to final retention policy.

## 16. IPM/PMC Landlord Relationships

Landlord list information should include as applicable:

- landlord name
- email
- phone
- property count
- tenant count
- permissions
- partnered/start date
- contract expiry date
- computed partnership status
- actions

Rules:

- Partnership status is derived consistently from relationship status and expiry.
- Both landlord and IPM/PMC can see partnered date, expiry date, and status.
- PMC Landlords View opens the expanded property/unit details for that landlord, not Dashboard and not an incomplete generic property page.
- IPM landlord list has equivalent useful columns and behavior.
- Search supports agreed identity and portfolio fields without leaking unrelated landlord data.
- Drop Landlord removes access and cached context from the IPM/PMC, while landlord-owned data remains intact.

## 17. Staff Lists And Assignment

- Admin IPM page lists only IPMs and pending IPM invites.
- Admin Staff page lists only Mushavo Homes admin staff.
- Landlord Staff page lists personal landlord staff, eligible IPM requests/relationships, and PMC requests/relationships in clearly separate concepts.
- PMC Staff page lists only that PMC's internal staff.
- Accepted accounts and pending invites must not appear as duplicates.
- Pending rows include Copy Link, Edit Invite, and Delete where applicable.
- Accepted rows include the relevant Edit Permissions, Suspend/Reactivate, Archive/Unarchive, Delete, or Unassign actions based on role ownership.
- An accepted IPM with zero landlords is Active, not Pending Approval. Landlord approval applies to data access, not to whether the IPM account exists.

## 18. Public Website

### 18.1 Home

- Clearly explains what Mushavo Homes is and who it benefits.
- Covers landlords, tenants, IPMs, and PMCs.
- Explains properties/units, rent and payments, leases/documents, maintenance, files, finance, and account collaboration.
- Uses the full available desktop width responsibly while remaining unchanged/responsive on phones.
- Logo is the brand; do not repeat a separate Mushavo Homes text wordmark next to it if redundant.

### 18.2 About

- Includes company vision, mission, goals, values, and who Mushavo Homes serves.
- Must match actual functionality and avoid unsupported claims.

### 18.3 Pricing

- Uses country-specific pricing for Zimbabwe and Malaysia.
- Supports monthly/yearly toggle.
- Yearly gives one month free.
- Clearly distinguishes Landlord, IPM, and PMC plans and allowances.
- Free landlord CTA goes to landlord signup.

### 18.4 Contact And Enquiries

- Country dropdown includes all countries, even unsupported markets.
- Submits directly to Supabase `enquiries`; do not open `mailto:`.
- Super admin sees all enquiries.
- Admin staff sees only enquiries from assigned countries.
- Success copy is customer-facing, for example: `Thank you. Your enquiry has been submitted successfully.`
- Never tell the customer that the team will review it `from the admin area` or expose internal workflow details.
- Enquiry form errors are friendly and do not expose Supabase internals.

## 19. Internationalization

- Supported languages:
  - English
  - Bahasa Melayu
  - Chinese
- `i18n.js` is the shared translation dictionary/system.
- Language selection persists in `localStorage` under `mushavo_language`.
- Translate all static and dynamically rendered UI text, including headings, labels, buttons, badges, empty states, dialogs, validation messages, table headings, and helper text.
- Do not translate user-created data: names, emails, property names, notes, filenames, or free-text descriptions.
- Do not translate the Mushavo Homes brand.
- Dynamic mixed labels such as Unit 24 and Paid/Unpaid need explicit formatting support.
- A translation change must scan all public files and `client.html`, not only the reported screenshot.
- Grammar must be natural in each language; do not use broken word-by-word substitutions.

## 20. UI, Responsive Layout, And Dialogs

- Mobile-first and no page-level horizontal scrolling at 320, 375, or 430 px.
- Tablet and desktop must use more available width without breaking phone layouts.
- Wide tables may scroll inside their own `overflow-x-auto` container only.
- Use responsive widths, `min-w-0`, wrapping, and stacked mobile controls.
- Inputs, buttons, and cards must fit the viewport.
- Long text and emails wrap or truncate intentionally.
- Navigation uses a mobile drawer/hamburger where needed.
- Use clear, modern, professional styling with consistent spacing and accessible contrast.
- Do not hide real layout bugs with global overflow clipping.
- All dialogs must:
  - fit within the viewport
  - use a scrollable content region on small/short screens
  - keep Close, Cancel, and Save/Accept/Delete actions reachable
  - allow Escape and visible X close where appropriate
  - prevent the background page from scrolling while open
  - restore background scrolling when closed
- Do not use browser `alert()` or `confirm()` for product actions.
- Use in-app confirmation and success/error dialogs.
- Visible form labels are required; do not rely only on placeholders.
- Keep pages clean by default: large add/create forms should be collapsed behind clear action buttons such as `Add Property`, `Add Tenant`, `Add Lease`, and `Add Maintenance`.
- When an add/create form is opened, provide a visible Cancel action and close/reset the form after a successful save.
- Apply the collapsed add-form pattern consistently across landlord, landlord staff, IPM, PMC, and PMC staff pages wherever they share the same properties, tenants, leases, or maintenance workflows.
- Do not hide filter/search controls that are needed for day-to-day list use, but avoid permanently showing bulky creation inputs at the top of every page.

## 21. User-Facing Errors

- Wrong email/password: `The email or password is incorrect.`
- Existing account during signup: `Your account already exists. Please contact Mushavo Homes Support.`
- Missing/deleted profile after valid Auth login: `Your account does not exist or has been removed. Please contact Mushavo Homes Support.`
- Do not show `Your session could not be verified` for ordinary wrong credentials.
- Do not expose SQL function names, table names, policy names, constraints, SQLSTATE codes, or raw Supabase messages.
- Translate known error categories into specific actions:
  - plan limit reached
  - permission denied
  - duplicate relationship
  - invite expired/used
  - invalid credentials
  - account suspended
  - subscription/trial expired
  - upload type/size failure
  - temporary connection failure
- Keep developer details in console logging only when safe; customer UI gets a clean message.

## 22. Known Failure Patterns To Prevent

These are mistakes that previously caused the owner to repeat instructions.

1. Only one creation path was changed while another path kept old defaults.
   - Prevention: test direct signup, admin, admin staff, IPM, and PMC landlord creation as one matrix.
2. Admin staff landlord creation still used Starter - Trial.
   - Prevention: centralize free landlord defaults and call the same RPC/helper from every path.
3. Free - Active saved in admin but old status remained in landlord shell.
   - Prevention: save plan/status atomically, reload subscription, clear stale local state, and use one display helper.
4. Expired rows displayed Active because timestamps were parsed incorrectly.
   - Prevention: one date parser and one computed-status helper for lists, badges, filters, and lockout.
5. Trial was treated as suspended.
   - Prevention: separate stored status, computed expiry, and suspension logic.
6. Broad permissions exposed unrelated buttons.
   - Prevention: exact helpers for each action plus RLS/trigger checks.
7. Pages disappeared when permissions were absent.
   - Prevention: navigation visibility and action authorization are separate rules.
8. A zero plan limit was replaced by a default because `||` was used.
   - Prevention: use `??` and test zero explicitly.
9. Limit counts included accepted accounts and stale invites twice.
   - Prevention: reconcile records and count unique active/pending identities deliberately.
10. Approved and Invited duplicate rows appeared.
    - Prevention: one lifecycle record where possible; otherwise de-duplicate by invite/profile/email and mark invite used atomically.
11. Raw RLS and constraint messages reached users.
    - Prevention: pre-check known cases and centralize database error translation.
12. User duplication checks happened after Auth signup.
    - Prevention: duplicate email/phone RPC runs before creating Auth user; registration is atomic or cleans up on failure.
13. Modal footers and X buttons were unreachable on smaller screens.
    - Prevention: one shared viewport-safe modal component/pattern used by every dialog.
14. Property units opened at the bottom of the entire list.
    - Prevention: render the selected units panel immediately after its property card.
15. Edit forms were cramped inside cards.
    - Prevention: reuse the full-width top form or a properly sized responsive modal.
16. Staff assignment listed people outside the current scope.
    - Prevention: use a server-filtered eligible-assignee query and enforce assignment scope in SQL.
17. Tenant relationship deletion deleted or blocked a reusable global account.
    - Prevention: archive landlord relationship; preserve tenant Auth/profile.
18. Personal landlord staff deletion left Auth behind.
    - Prevention: personal staff delete RPC removes Auth/profile and allows re-invite; IPM unassignment does not delete IPM identity.
19. Auth refresh on tab focus reset the page to Dashboard.
    - Prevention: ignore same-user refresh events and preserve current shell/page.
20. RLS policies caused infinite recursion.
    - Prevention: use carefully scoped security-definer helpers instead of policies querying each other.
21. New enum values were used before their transaction committed.
    - Prevention: add enum values in a committed migration step before using them in constraints/policies.
22. SQL references were ambiguous, such as receipt year.
    - Prevention: qualify columns and parameters consistently.
23. `ON CONFLICT` targeted columns without a matching unique constraint.
    - Prevention: add/verify the intended unique constraint before using the conflict target.
24. Translation was added only to obvious navigation labels.
    - Prevention: scan all rendered text and test each role/page in all supported languages.
25. Internal implementation wording appeared in customer messages.
    - Prevention: review success/error text from the customer's perspective.

## 23. Required Regression Matrices

### 23.1 Landlord Creation Matrix

Test all five routes:

| Route | Expected result |
|---|---|
| Direct landlord signup | Active - Free and free limits |
| Super admin invite | Active - Free and free limits |
| Admin staff invite | Active - Free and free limits |
| IPM invite | Active - Free, pending IPM request, no IPM access yet |
| PMC invite | Active - Free, pending PMC request, no PMC access yet |

Verify only one profile, one active subscription, and one visible relationship/invite lifecycle per account.

### 23.2 Subscription Matrix

Test for landlord, IPM, and PMC where supported:

- Free - Active
- paid plan - Trial before expiry
- paid plan - Trial after expiry
- paid plan - Active before expiry
- paid plan - Active after expiry
- Suspended before expiry
- Suspended after expiry
- missing/malformed old expiry data

Verify admin list, top badge, My Account, filters, and lockout page agree.

### 23.3 Permission Matrix

For landlord staff, IPM, PMC, and PMC staff:

- each parent permission alone
- each child with parent off
- each child with parent on
- every sibling off while one action is on
- direct database write attempt with UI bypassed
- PMC staff narrower than PMC grant

Verify page remains visible, unauthorized controls/details are hidden, and backend denies unauthorized writes.

### 23.4 Deletion Matrix

- archive tenant relationship, then connect same tenant to another landlord
- delete personal landlord staff, then re-invite same email
- unassign IPM without deleting IPM account
- drop landlord from PMC/IPM and confirm data disappears only from partner view
- archive/unarchive users as admin
- permanently delete as admin with history behavior verified

### 23.5 Responsive Matrix

Test at:

- 320 px
- 375 px
- 430 px
- 768 px
- 1024 px
- wide desktop

Check every dialog, table, navigation drawer, form, long email, action group, and expanded property/unit panel.

### 23.6 Language Matrix

For English, Bahasa Melayu, and Chinese, inspect:

- public pages
- login/signup/invite screens
- admin and admin staff
- landlord and landlord staff
- IPM
- PMC leader and PMC staff
- tenant
- all dialogs, errors, empty states, badges, and table headings

## 24. Technical Verification Before Handoff

For every frontend change:

1. Parse-check all inline JavaScript in changed HTML files.
2. Run `node --check` on `i18n.js` when changed.
3. Search for accidental old branding, secrets, mojibake, TODOs, stubs, and placeholder logic.
4. Verify referenced RPC names exist in SQL.
5. Verify SQL functions use columns that exist and conflict targets have matching unique constraints.
6. Confirm RLS allows the intended role and rejects an out-of-scope role.
7. Check that raw Supabase errors are translated.
8. Check mobile dialogs and page overflow.
9. Synchronize source and output copies.
10. State clearly if SQL still needs to be run by the owner.

Suggested scans:

```text

TODO
stub
placeholder logic

```

## 25. Before Marking A Task Complete

Answer these questions:

- Did I find every path that implements this rule?
- Did I update frontend and database enforcement where needed?
- Did I test the role that reported the bug and all other affected roles?
- Did I preserve zero values and avoid duplicate counting?
- Did I update existing rows instead of creating duplicate lifecycle rows?
- Did I check archive, delete, unassign, and historical-record consequences?
- Did I check all supported languages?
- Did I check small-screen dialogs and horizontal overflow?
- Did I replace raw technical errors with customer-facing text?
- Did I update this rules file if the product decision changed?

Do not mark the work complete if a required answer is unknown. Report the exact unverified area instead.

## 26. Dropdown And Dialog State Rule

Do not let dropdowns visually reset to the first option when an existing record is reopened.

This issue already happened with country and plan/status fields: the value saved correctly in Supabase, but reopening the dialog showed `Unassigned` or the first dropdown option. This must not happen again.

For every Alpine `<select>` using `x-model`, especially in edit dialogs, subscription dialogs, filters, and any dropdown whose options are rendered with `x-for`:

- add an after-render sync such as `x-effect='$nextTick(() => { $el.value = form.field ?? "" })'`
- store stable IDs or enum values, not display labels, when saving references such as country, landlord, tenant, unit, staff, plan/status, payer, or property
- when opening edit dialogs, resolve saved names/codes/legacy values back to the correct ID before assigning the form state
- after saving, refresh or update the local row so reopening the dialog shows the latest saved value
- verify by selecting a non-first option, saving, closing, reopening, and confirming the same option is selected

If a dropdown is inside a modal/dialog, it must also remain usable on smaller screens with a scrollable dialog body and visible close/cancel/save actions.

## 27. Table Sorting Rule

If a table heading shows a sort arrow, clicking that heading must actually sort the visible rows.

Do not leave decorative arrows that only change direction without changing row order. Alpine-rendered tables can re-render from their original arrays, so sorting must either:

- sort the underlying filtered data returned by the relevant `filtered...()` function, or
- store the clicked table column/direction and reapply the DOM row sort after Alpine finishes rendering.

For every list/table in admin, admin staff, landlord, landlord staff, tenant, IPM, PMC, and PMC staff accounts:

- text columns sort alphabetically with case-insensitive natural sorting
- number and currency columns sort numerically
- date columns sort by date
- never treat normal alphabetic text as numeric zero; a numeric parser must only return a number when the whole cell is genuinely numeric or currency-like
- sorting must still work after filtering, refreshing, or changing pages
- empty-state rows with `colspan` are not sortable data rows
- Actions columns should not be treated as meaningful business sorting unless explicitly required

Before handoff, click a non-default column such as Account, Country, Name, Property, Amount, Expiry, or Status and confirm the row order changes correctly.

## 28. Admin Dashboard And Notes Rule

Admin and admin staff must both have a Dashboard page as the default landing page. The dashboard should summarize landlords, finance, enquiries, IPM, PMC, and notes without removing the dedicated detail pages.

Admin notes are operational data and must be stored in Supabase, not only in local browser state. Notes must support:

- personal notes visible only to the creator and super admin
- assigned notes visible to the assigned admin staff member, the creator, and super admin
- admin staff assigning notes to the super admin/admin
- editing notes
- ticking notes as done
- deleting notes only by super admin or the note creator

Any note feature must have matching RLS. Do not rely only on hidden buttons for privacy.
Do not restrict admin staff note assignees to only themselves. The assignee list must include super admin/admin for admin staff, and RLS must allow that assignment while still blocking unrelated users.

## 29. Historical Payment Records Rule

Landlords, IPMs, and PMCs must be able to enter historical/backdated rent payments when onboarding an existing tenant or property into Mushavo Homes. This is for verified records that already happened before the account started using the platform.

Historical payment entry belongs to manager-side payment logging only:

- landlord/IPM/PMC manual payment logging may include a "Historical rent month" option
- unit-level manager payment logging may include a "Historical rent month" option
- tenant proof submission must not include historical/backdated rent options

Historical rent records must be saved as structured rent payments with:

- `payment_purpose = 'rent'`
- `is_historical = true`
- a real `rent_period_start` and `rent_period_end` for the selected month

Other payments such as repairs, maintenance, deposit top-ups, late fees, or custom charges must not reduce rent balance. Do not infer payment purpose only from free-text notes or labels. Store a structured purpose such as `payment_purpose` and use it in balance logic.

Tenant current balance should only subtract verified rent payments for the current rent month. Historical rent for previous months should remain in payment history and reports, but it should not reduce the current month balance.

Updated balance rule: tenant `Current Balance` must show all outstanding rent due from the active lease start month through the current month, not only the current month. For each due month, subtract only verified rent payments assigned to that rent period. Deposits, maintenance payments, repairs, late fees, and custom `other` payments must never reduce rent balance or revenue unless explicitly classified as rent.

## 30. Tenant-Landlord Request Lifecycle Rule

An existing Mushavo Homes tenant account must never become available to a landlord merely because the landlord searched for the tenant or sent a request. The relationship has a strict lifecycle:

- `pending`: the landlord sent a request, but the tenant has not responded
- `accepted`: the tenant explicitly accepted; only now may the landlord see the tenant in Accepted Tenants and assign the tenant to a unit
- `rejected`: the tenant rejected; the request disappears from Requests Sent and never appears in Accepted Tenants

Required behavior:

- Landlord Tenants page shows pending invitations and existing-account requests in a visible `Requests Sent` section above `Accepted Tenants`.
- A pending tenant is filtered out of every accepted-tenant selector and assignment action.
- Tenant Notifications persist and display the response status. After responding, replace Accept/Reject buttons with an `Accepted` or `Rejected` badge.
- Accepting sets the matching tenant relationship to `profile_id = auth.uid()` and `invite_accepted = true` through the security-definer RPC.
- Rejecting archives only the pending relationship row through the RPC.
- Tenant Settings shows every accepted landlord relationship, including landlord contact details and the linked property/unit where available.
- Dropping a landlord is allowed only after there is no active lease. It must not delete historical leases, payments, receipts, or landlord records.
- RPC errors must be visible. Successful responses reload notifications, accepted-landlord settings, unread counts, and relationship data.
- Notification response state is stored in Supabase, not inferred only from temporary browser state.

Before handoff, test the complete lifecycle with two accounts: send a request, confirm it appears only under Requests Sent, accept and confirm it moves to Accepted Tenants plus Tenant Settings, then repeat and confirm Reject removes the pending request without creating an accepted relationship.

## 31. Stable Loading And Mobile Layout Rule

Refreshing data must not make pages jump up and down. Once a page section has loaded once, background refreshes must keep the existing cards, rows, and containers visible while new data is fetched.

Required behavior:

- use `beginDataLoad(sectionKey, bucket)` and `finishDataLoad(sectionKey, bucket)` for section-level loaders
- only show full loading/empty placeholders on the first load of that section
- never set a visible page/table bucket back to `loading = true` during a normal refresh if data has already loaded
- table and panel containers need stable minimum height so the rest of the page does not collapse while data is refreshing
- on phones, fix overflow at the source with `w-full`, `max-w-full`, `min-w-0`, responsive grids/flex, and internal table `overflow-x-auto`
- the whole page must not horizontally scroll on mobile; only wide tables may scroll inside their own wrapper
- do not use `overflow-x-hidden` as the only fix for broken layout; it may be used only after the actual oversized element is constrained

Before handoff, check at least 320px, 375px, 430px, tablet, and desktop sizes for page-wide horizontal scrolling and visible layout jumps after refresh/add/edit/delete.

## 32. Direct Signup Country Rule

Direct landlord and tenant signup must require a country and save it everywhere the account needs it. Do not let new direct signups default to `Unassigned`.

Required behavior:

- landlord signup form includes a required country dropdown loaded from active countries
- tenant signup form includes a required country dropdown loaded from active countries
- signup dropdowns must use stable country IDs and the dropdown state sync rule so reopening/rendering does not fall back to the first option
- `profiles.country_id` must be saved for both landlord and tenant signups
- landlord signup must save the country to `landlord_subscriptions.country_id`
- tenant signup must save the country to `tenants.country_id`
- the unauthenticated signup page must be able to read active countries through a safe public countries select policy
- if signup RPC signatures change, the full SQL file must include `drop function if exists` statements for old signatures before recreating the functions, and grants must be updated for the new signatures

Before handoff, test landlord signup and tenant signup with a non-first country option, then confirm the created profile/account row keeps that country after refresh and in admin edit dialogs.

## 33. Country And Market Display Rule

Mushavo Homes can store a full world country list for public signup and country-code selection, but admin country cards must not show every country in the world by default.

Required behavior:

- Public landlord signup and tenant signup may show all world countries in the country dropdown.
- Admin/admin staff country cards should show only actual Mushavo Homes markets: countries explicitly added/enabled by admin or countries that already have landlord/user activity.
- Admin staff can only select and manage countries assigned to them.
- Admin staff cannot add countries.
- Add Country must use a controlled country dropdown sourced from the known country list, not a free-text country name, to avoid spelling/currency/code conflicts.
- Adding a country must create or activate that country as a Mushavo Homes market so it appears in admin country cards and relevant admin filters.

## 34. Public Signup Page Split Rule

Direct account creation pages must be separated from `client.html`.

Required behavior:

- `client.html` remains the login/authenticated client area.
- Direct free landlord signup belongs on its own page, such as `landlord-signup.html`.
- Direct tenant signup belongs on its own page, such as `tenant-signup.html`.
- Login page buttons link to those separate pages instead of rendering large signup forms inside `client.html`.
- If a landlord searches for a tenant and the tenant does not exist, the generated invite/copy action must point to the tenant signup page only.
- If an IPM or PMC searches for a landlord and the landlord does not exist, the generated invite/copy action must point to the free landlord signup page only.
- Do not expose raw signup URLs as the main visible success text. Use user-friendly text such as `Free tenant signup link ready. Copy and send it to the tenant.` while keeping a Copy Link button available.

## 35. Customer-Facing Wording Rule

Customer-facing website messages must not reveal internal operational details.

Examples:

- Contact/enquiry success text should say `Enquiry submitted. The Mushavo Homes team will review it.`
- Do not say the enquiry will be reviewed in the admin area.
- Tenant/landlord invite messages should explain what the customer needs to do, not database/admin mechanics.
- Supabase/RPC errors must be translated into clear product language where possible.

## 36. Admin Pricing Control Rule

Admin must have a Pricing page in the client area to control public pricing and default plan limits.

Required behavior:

- Admin pricing records drive what appears on the public `pricing.html` page.
- Admin pricing records also drive the default limits shown when admin/admin staff creates or edits landlord, IPM, and PMC subscriptions.
- Pricing records include country, account type, plan, monthly price, yearly price, public visibility, and all relevant limits.
- Yearly public pricing should show one month free, not two months free.
- Unit limits mean units per property where the product decision says that, especially for landlord pricing.
- IPM limits include landlord count and property-per-landlord limits.
- PMC limits include landlords, properties, units, and staff limits.
- If a table heading has a sort arrow on the pricing page, sorting must work on the visible filtered rows.

## 37. IPM/PMC Finance Naming And Scope Rule

IPM and PMC finance must not be confused with a landlord's own finance page.

Required behavior:

- Landlord Finance is private to the landlord and must not be exposed to IPMs or PMCs through landlord permissions.
- IPM/PMC `Payments` menu label should be `Landlord Payments` when it refers to payments collected from their connected landlords.
- IPM/PMC `Finance` menu label should be `Personal Finance` when it refers to the IPM/PMC's own business revenue and records.
- IPM/PMC personal finance should have a finance dashboard similar to admin finance, but scoped to connected landlords instead of countries.
- IPM/PMC can record payments from landlords they serve, including amount, paid date, period from/to, payment type/plan where applicable, and history.
- Dropping a landlord removes IPM/PMC access to that landlord's current data, but the landlord's own data and history must remain intact.

## 38. Admin Notes Assignment Rule

When creating or editing an assigned admin note:

- If the creator selects `assign to staff`, the assignee dropdown must not show the creator's own name.
- Admin staff must still be able to assign notes to the super admin/admin.
- Super admin/admin can assign notes to admin staff.
- RLS must still enforce who can view, edit, complete, and delete notes.

## 39. Property Units Toggle Rule

On property cards, the unit panel must be controlled by the property card button itself.

Required behavior:

- When units are closed, the property card button says `Open Units`.
- When that property's units are open, the same button says `Close Units`.
- The duplicate `Close Units` button beside the units panel Refresh button should not appear.
- The expanded units panel must open directly under the selected property card, not at the bottom of the whole property list.

## 40. Granular Refresh And Realtime Rule

Realtime/callback updates should refresh only the affected data section and must preserve the current view state.

Required behavior:

- A landlord selector change in an IPM or PMC account must not trigger a global reload on unrelated landlord or tenant pages.
- Data changes should update only the affected page section/component where possible.
- Do not reset `currentPage`, selected tabs, open unit panels, selected landlord, filters, or scroll position during background refreshes.
- Use section-level refresh functions instead of full app reloads for add/edit/delete/payment/notification updates.
- Keep stable container sizes during refresh to avoid flicker or jumping.

## 41. Mobile Header And Menu Rule

All account shells must use the clean mobile header pattern that fits on phone screens.

Required behavior:

- Logo and role/account label fit without overlapping topbar controls.
- On mobile, navigation goes behind a hamburger/menu button.
- Notification bell remains visible on the main mobile header.
- Logout should move into the mobile menu/drawer instead of crowding the main topbar.
- Plan/status badges that do not fit on mobile should move into the mobile menu/drawer.
- The phone layout must not horizontally scroll.

## 42. Tenant Relationship Data Retention Rule

Dropping or ending a tenant-landlord relationship must not delete historical records.

Required behavior:

- Marking a unit vacant ends the active lease/unit assignment but does not delete tenant profile, payments, receipts, lease history, or maintenance history.
- Tenant can drop a landlord only after there is no active lease.
- Dropping the landlord removes the landlord's active access to the tenant identity but keeps historical landlord records intact.
- Accepted tenant relationships must remain visible until the lifecycle explicitly ends through vacancy/drop rules.

## 43. Prompt And Rules Update Rule

Do not update `rules.md` or `rentradar_next_chat_prompt.md` unless the owner explicitly asks for it.

When the owner does ask for an update:

- Update the canonical working branch and keep it synchronized with the verified GitHub repository.
- Include the latest product decisions, regressions, and workflow rules since the last update.
- Keep the rules practical and testable, not vague.
- If a rule affects code and SQL, state that both the frontend and Supabase layer must enforce it.

## 44. Canonical Local Source Rule

The canonical source folder is:

`C:\Users\HP\Desktop\Mushavo Homes`

Required behavior:

- Work from this folder unless the owner explicitly changes the source of truth.
- Do not edit or push directly to `main`; use a focused feature, fix, or reconciliation branch.
- Do not use old `ne\outputs` files as the source of truth unless the owner explicitly asks.
- When SQL or HTML is changed, update the whole relevant local file, not loose snippets.

## 45. Fresh Supabase Install Rule

The schema must work on an empty Supabase project after the owner has deleted all tables, auth users, RLS policies, functions, triggers, and storage objects.

Required behavior:

- Tables must be created before triggers, policies, or functions that reference them.
- Helper functions must exist before RLS policies or RPCs call them.
- No policy or function may reference missing objects such as old helper names, removed tables, or stale columns.
- If a function signature, parameter name, or return type changes, include `drop function if exists ...` before recreating it.
- The super admin usage block is optional and should not be rerun if that auth user already exists.

## 46. Country Visibility And Assignment Rule

Countries are handled differently depending on context.

Required behavior:

- Public signups, tenant signup, landlord signup, contact forms, and country dropdowns may show all countries in the world.
- Admin Landlord Management must not show every world country by default. It should show `All countries` plus countries that have landlords or have been intentionally added as active markets.
- Add Country must use a dropdown from the world country list instead of free text.
- Admin staff can be assigned one or more countries.
- Admin staff can only register, edit, view, and manage country-related records inside their assigned countries.
- Saved country dropdowns must reopen with the saved country selected, not `Unassigned` or the first option.

## 47. Signup And Invite Page Rule

Landlord and tenant account creation must be separated from the main login page.

Required behavior:

- Free landlord signup lives on its own page, such as `landlord-signup.html`.
- Tenant signup lives on its own page, such as `tenant-signup.html`.
- `client.html` should link to those pages instead of embedding the full signup flows.
- If a landlord, IPM, or PMC invites a tenant who is not on Mushavo Homes, the generated link must point to the tenant signup page.
- If an IPM or PMC invites a landlord who is not on Mushavo Homes, the generated link must point to the free landlord signup page.
- Do not display raw invite URLs as the main success message. Use friendly text such as `Free tenant signup link ready. Copy and send it to the tenant.`

## 48. Tenant Link Request Rule

Tenant search and linking must preserve tenant consent.

Required behavior:

- If an existing tenant is found, send a request/notification only.
- The tenant must accept before they appear in the accepted tenant list or assignable tenant dropdown.
- Rejected requests should disappear from the landlord request list and must not create an accepted relationship.
- After accepting, the notification should show accepted or be removed from pending actions, and the tenant Settings page should show the accepted landlord.
- Landlords need a visible pending tenant requests list or page after sending requests.
- Accept/reject buttons must call working handlers and persist the state in Supabase.
- Dropping the tenant-landlord relationship must not delete landlord payment, lease, receipt, maintenance, or audit history.

## 49. Subscription Status Rule

Plan/status, expiry, suspension, and trial are separate concepts and must not be mixed.

Required behavior:

- Display combined labels as `Plan / Status`, for example `Starter - Active`, `Growth - Trial`, `Free - Active`.
- Headings should say `Plan / Status` where the combined value is shown.
- Trial is a valid account state and must not lock the user out.
- Suspended accounts show the suspension screen.
- Expired subscriptions show the subscription expired screen.
- Expired status must be derived from expiry dates for landlords, IPMs, and PMCs in admin/admin staff lists.
- Suspending an account must preserve the existing plan/status values so unsuspending restores the same plan/status.
- New landlord direct signups and landlord invites from IPM/PMC default to `Free - Active`, 1 property, 1 unit, Finance page, 0 personal staff, 1 IPM/PMC connection, and no practical expiry.

## 50. Payment And Finance Logic Rule

Payment logic must match real accounting behavior.

Required behavior:

- Tenant current balance is rent balance only and should include outstanding rent from previous months.
- Rent payments reduce rent balance.
- Non-rent payments, maintenance payments, and `Other` payments must not reduce rent balance.
- When payment purpose is `Other`, label the amount field as `Amount`, not `Rent amount`, and require a description.
- Deposit appears in payment-purpose options when unpaid, but deposits do not count as revenue.
- Payment history should support PDF receipt download wherever payments are listed.
- Admin payment recording should choose from pricing plans and monthly/yearly options, auto-fill amount, and allow amount edits.
- Admin staff must not edit or delete payment history or payment entries.

## 51. Maintenance And Staff Assignment Rule

Maintenance permissions and staff assignment must be strict.

Required behavior:

- A user without create-maintenance permission must not see or use maintenance creation controls.
- A user without assign-maintenance permission must not see assignment dropdowns.
- Assignment dropdowns must only show staff who are actually under or allowed for that landlord, PMC, IPM, property, or unit scope.
- Resolution-note controls require the matching resolution permission.
- Maintenance delete buttons should exist only where deletion is allowed.
- Landlord and PMC/IPM unit detail views should show which staff person is assigned to the unit.

## 52. Pricing Management Rule

Admin controls public pricing and default subscription limits from the admin Pricing page.

Required behavior:

- Public pricing cards should read from the pricing plan data.
- Admin Pricing edits should update public pricing display and default limits used when adding landlords, IPMs, and PMCs.
- Pricing tables must not drop important columns to save space; use horizontal scrolling inside the table container if needed.
- The yearly billing toggle should show `1 month free`.
- IPM plans need a per-landlord property assignment limit, and that limit must be enforced when landlords assign properties to the IPM.

## 53. Phase Delivery Rule

When working through a product phase, finish the whole phase scope or clearly state what remains.

Required behavior:

- At phase completion, list the files/areas changed.
- Give a testing checklist for the features added or changed.
- Do not claim a phase is complete if listed phase items were skipped.
- Keep phase work scoped and avoid spending time on unrelated cleanup unless it blocks the phase.

## 54. Phase 6 CRM And Public Vacancy Rule

Phase 6 is the public vacancy and internal leads flow.

Required behavior:

- Public available-unit listings show safe details only: country, city/area, property name or area, unit summary, rent, availability, and approved photos.
- Exact addresses stay hidden publicly.
- General contact enquiries remain separate from listing leads.
- Listing leads, viewing requests, follow-ups, saved leads, lead activity, and conversion tracking are managed internally.
- Lead conversion creates a tenant-link request first; it must not automatically create a lease.
- Admin sees all listing leads; admin staff only sees assigned-country listing leads.
- Landlord sees their own listing leads.
- IPM/PMC sees listing leads only for assigned landlord/property scope.
- Staff actions depend on permissions: `can_publish_listings`, `can_manage_leads`, and `can_schedule_viewings`.

## 55. Phase 7 Permissions And Audit Rule

Permissions and audit control are core product behavior, not optional UI polish.

Required behavior:

- Maintain one central permission matrix for landlord staff, PMC staff, IPM/PMC access, and any delegated user.
- Parent permissions control child permissions. Example: a user cannot edit a unit unless they can view units; a user cannot archive a property unless they can view properties.
- If permission is missing, hide the button, dropdown, field, or sensitive information entirely.
- UI permission checks must match Supabase RLS/function checks. Never rely on the UI alone.
- Log create, edit, delete, archive, approve, reject, export, and financial-record view actions in audit history.
- Admin can see audit logs. Admin staff must not see the audit page.
- Admin staff must not delete/archive landlords, IPMs, PMCs, or edit/delete payment history.

## 56. Phase 8 Automation Rule

Automation must create useful reminders without misleading the user during loading.

Required behavior:

- Automation covers rent due reminders, overdue rent alerts, lease expiry reminders, subscription expiry reminders, maintenance escalation, payment received notifications, and custom message templates.
- Automation pages must show loading/skeleton states while data is being fetched. Do not briefly show `0` or `No records found` before the real data arrives.
- Automation status messages are page-scoped and must disappear when the user navigates to another page.
- Email integration is a later layer. Keep notification records and templates ready for email, but do not expose API keys in client HTML.

## 57. Page-Scoped Feedback Rule

Success, error, and status messages must belong only to the page/action that created them.

Required behavior:

- Clear transient feedback when `currentPage` changes.
- Do not carry messages such as `Automation checks completed` onto unrelated pages.
- Keep modal/dialog state separate from page feedback so confirmations and QR dialogs are not accidentally cleared mid-action.
- Use user-friendly error messages. Do not show raw Supabase errors for limit checks, signup checks, permission checks, or subscription checks.

## 58. Mobile Header And Menu Rule

Every account type must use the same clean mobile header pattern that works on admin/admin staff.

Required behavior:

- On mobile, show logo, account label/name, notification bell where applicable, language selector, and hamburger menu without overlap.
- Logout belongs inside the mobile menu/drawer.
- Plan/status badges that do not fit in the mobile header must move into the menu/drawer.
- Admin and admin staff must use a menu/drawer because the full menu no longer fits horizontally.
- Menu order for admin/admin staff: Dashboard, Notes, Landlords, IPM, PMC, Staff, Tenants, Finance, Enquiries, Pricing, Leads, Automation, Audit.
- Skip unavailable pages for admin staff. Audit is admin-only.

## 59. Signup And Invite Link Rule

Signup and invite flows must use the correct public pages and clear customer-facing language.

Required behavior:

- Free landlord signup and tenant signup are separate pages from `client.html`.
- After successful landlord signup, redirect the user to the login/client page.
- If IPM/PMC invites a landlord who is not on Mushavo Homes, provide the free landlord signup page link only.
- If a landlord invites a tenant who is not on Mushavo Homes, provide the tenant signup page link only.
- Do not display raw generated links as success messages. Use messages such as `Free tenant signup link ready. Copy and send it to the tenant.`
- If QR codes are generated for links, they must point to the same temporary invite/signup URL and inherit the same expiry/safety behavior.

## 60. Tenant Relationship Rule

Existing tenants must always consent before they become assignable to a landlord.

Required behavior:

- Searching an existing tenant sends a request only.
- The tenant must accept before appearing in Accepted Tenants.
- Rejection removes the pending request.
- Landlord pages must show pending tenant requests separately from accepted tenants.
- Tenant Settings must list accepted landlords and show Drop Landlord only when the tenant has no active lease/unit relationship with that landlord.
- Dropping a tenant-landlord relationship must not delete historical leases, payments, receipts, maintenance, or financial records.

## 61. Form And Panel Density Rule

Large create/edit forms should not permanently consume page space.

Required behavior:

- Add forms on operational pages should be collapsed by default behind an Add button.
- After successful submit, collapse the form again.
- Applies to properties, tenants, leases, maintenance, notes, and equivalent landlord staff/IPM/PMC/PMC staff pages.
- Property unit panels open directly below the selected property card.
- When a property's units are open, the property card button changes to `Close Units`; do not show a second close button beside Refresh.

## 62. Dialog Responsiveness Rule

All dialogs must work on small screens.

Required behavior:

- Dialogs need max-height and internal scrolling.
- The X button, Cancel button, and Save/Submit button must always be reachable.
- Dropdowns must reopen with the saved value selected, not the first/default option.
- If a select value saves to the database, the edit modal must hydrate from the saved value on reopen.

## 63. Countries Rule

Country handling must be consistent across admin, signup, and staff-scoped actions.

Required behavior:

- Admin country cards show only countries with landlords/active markets, plus `All countries`.
- Landlord signup and tenant signup country selectors show all world countries.
- Add Country should use a dropdown from the world country list to avoid spelling/code/currency conflicts.
- Admin staff can only select and manage assigned countries.
- One admin staff member can be assigned to multiple countries.

## 64. Finance And Balance Rule

Payments must affect the correct financial area.

Required behavior:

- Tenant current balance is rent-only and includes outstanding historical rent.
- Non-rent payments such as maintenance or `Other` do not reduce rent balance.
- `Other` payment type requires a description and the amount label should be `Amount`, not `Rent amount`.
- Deposit can appear as a payment option when unpaid, but deposits are refundable and must not count as revenue.
- IPM/PMC `Landlord Payments` are payments received from connected landlords.
- IPM/PMC `Personal Finance` is the IPM/PMC business finance dashboard, separate from landlord rent finance.

## 65. Admin Staff Suspension Rule

Suspended admin staff must get a clear suspension state.

Required behavior:

- If admin suspends an admin staff account, login should show a suspension message such as `Your account is suspended. Please contact the admin.`
- Do not show `This account role is not supported` for suspended staff.
- Suspended status pauses access but should not delete the staff profile or country assignments.

## 66. Working File Rule

Use the local project as the source of truth unless the user explicitly changes it.

Required behavior:

- Work locally in `C:\Users\HP\Desktop\Mushavo Homes`.
- Do not edit or push directly to `main`; use a focused feature or fix branch.
- When asked for HTML or SQL changes, update the full local file rather than giving isolated snippets.
- Update this rules file and the next-chat prompt only when the user explicitly asks.

## Current Local File Rule

The active Mushavo Homes workspace is `C:\Users\HP\Desktop\Mushavo Homes`. All future edits, checks, and file references must use this folder unless the user explicitly gives a different path. Do not use older local copies for implementation work; compare with the latest GitHub `main` before branching.
